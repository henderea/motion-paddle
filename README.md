# motion-paddle

Paddle for vendors: <https://vendors.paddle.com>
You will have to vendor the Paddle framework yourself because I can't get the gem to bundle it properly.
More info coming soon.  In the meantime, you can see the gem in use in my MemoryTamer app <https://github.com/henderea/MemoryTamer>.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-paddle'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install motion-paddle
